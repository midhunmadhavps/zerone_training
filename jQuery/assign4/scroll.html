                <p>
                    With Zerone beginning its journey as far back as 2004, .NET and open source development were our key areas of focus. In fact,
                    it was also during these formative years that our very first projects in Data Analytics and IoT came
                    to fruition too. In keeping up with the latest industry best practices, we adopted the Agile software
                    development practice and which has been key in building process maturity over the years. Once we embraced
                    organizational transformation from within, it was time to share our expertise and experience with those
                    in need of our services and solutions. Since then, Zerone has forged ahead of the competition with an
                    enviable client portfolio that has culminated in the delivery of more than five hundred projects. As
                    a result, both NASSCOM and the Mirror Review have recognised our contribution to the broader digital
                    transformation mantra that businesses have embraced and implemented across the board. Some of our innovative
                    solutions used in development include .NET, J2EE, J2ME, WordPress CMS, Alfresco, Magento, Python, MERN
                    and MEAN Stack etc. along the way.
